# Calming-Quote

## Overview
**Calming-Quote** is a website built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript (TSX)**. It provides a good experience with a starry background, shooting stars, a daily motivational quote in the center, and a Lo-Fi music player at the bottom of the page. The purpose of the website is to help users relax, reflect, and find peace while watching the stars, listening to calming music, and thinking about the day's quote.

## Features
- **Starry Background:** A beautiful, dynamic starry sky with shooting stars (from [Acternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/shooting-stars-and-stars-background) ).
- **Daily Motivational Quote:** A quote displayed at the center of the page to inspire and motivate (Hard-Coded in JSON format).
- **Lo-Fi Music Player:** A music player that plays relaxing Lo-Fi music, perfect for sleep or contemplation (Lo-Fi audios are from different artist on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com).
- **Open for Contributions:** If you'd like to contribute, feel free to open a pull request!

## Note
The Code is specialized for German people (Quotes are written in German), I'd be happy if someone picks some English quotes and add a button that toggles between languages.
